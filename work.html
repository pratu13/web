            <p class="grid-item-text" style="text-align: justify; color:#000;">The need to be able to operate effectively in areas where GPS is inaccessible, unreliable
                or potentially denied by adversaries has created a demand for navigation capabilities. To
                address this need, Group Tracking System is developed that has the potential to deliver
                the same functionality without the constraints mentioned above. The system will allow
                all the groups involved to view each other’s activity and position and thus will have a
                knowledge of how far they are from each other creating a safe environment. The system
                does not restrict itself to outdoors which is the main advantage when compared to the
                GPS system.</p>
